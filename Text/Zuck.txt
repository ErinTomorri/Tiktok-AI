Voice: Zuck

What's that Musk

It must be

This ugly

Old white pleb

In his over priced

Humvee

Grab the trumpet

When trump tried to trump me

I beat that fed case 

told the courts they can ZUCK ME

Cut the beat

Let me tweet my bird song

- Dankton

Elon my brother

Please put a shirt on

Was that ya best rap

to go verse for verse on

Cause this a death match

we go hearse for hearse son

I got some bils to make

And I got time for war

Better bet I charge fast

like a lightning cord

I got bills and gates

I got a job for jobs

You like bill gates

You got a Micro-Soft

Fuck you and fuck spacex

matter fact, I wish your dad used a muthafuckin latex

I didn't wanna curse,

but I did it for the verse,

That's meta, do you get it?

cause i'm runnin outta patience

- Dankton

Good gracious

I'm seeing thru the Matrix

Twitters zero - one

Yeah That means no payslips

I threw a face hook

and tagged you on face book

With lyrics from this verse that just blew up like ya spaceship

- Dankton
