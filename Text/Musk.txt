Voice: Musk

Alright Jamie,

It's the day

we're here with Elon Musk

and Marky Mark

Today I want a clean fight boys

No racism

No spacism

no facebookism

We cannot be cancelled for this

- Dankton

It's the rocket man

Baby call me elton john

You know my rocket e-lon-ger

than a telethon

You ban conspiracies 

And pander liberally

My bars are the thing

them steel beams got melted from 

Stick your mark

Mark man

I'ma Marksman

I'm Part Martian and part

rope swinging tarzan

This the part

where I rip apart

parts of ya

past

with the parts

that i've written on this parchment

- Dankton

Ok Mark

lets talk Facebook Data Leaks

You severed vein lines

of your users main arteries

You tippy toed gray lines 

With your marketing

So tell these nice people

how those ads are so targetting

And not to stutter or get all

sinister but we need to talk about camebridge analytica

You made your mark, mark, sellin' all their da-ta

you earned that reaction like soda & vinegar

- Dankton

What goes around comes around

Like the Do-si-do

So I invested all in

to this lonely road

I Hope you get this message

And you know

That I just dropped you like the tesla stock

did when I smoked with joe

- Dankton
