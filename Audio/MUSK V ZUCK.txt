Alright Jamie,

It's the day

we're here with Elon Musk

and Marky Mark

Today I want a clean fight boys

No racism

No spacism

no facebookism

We cannot be cancelled for this


It's the rocket man

Baby call me elton john

You know my rocket e-lon-ger

than a telethon

You ban conspiracies 

And pander liberally

My bars are the thing

them steel beams got melted from 

Stick your mark

Mark man

I'ma Marksman

I'm Part Martian and part

rope swinging tarzan

This the part

where I rip apart

parts of ya

past

with the parts

that i've written on this parchment

Ok Mark

lets talk Facebook Data Leaks

You severed vein lines

of your users main arteries

You tippy toed gray lines 

With your marketing

So tell these nice people

how those ads are so targetting

And not to stutter or get all

sinister but we need to talk about camebridge analytica

You made your mark, mark, sellin' all their da-ta

you earned that reaction like soda & vinegar


What goes around comes around

Like the Do-si-do

So I invested all in

to this lonely road

I Hope you get this message

And you know

That I just dropped you like the tesla stock

did when I smoked with joe

What's that Musk

It must be

This ugly

Old white pleb

In his over priced

Humvee

Grab the trumpet

When trump tried to trump me

I beat that fed case 

told the courts they can ZUCK ME

Cut the beat

Let me tweet my bird song

Elon my brother

Please put a shirt on

Was that ya best rap

to go verse for verse on

Cause this a death match

we go hearse for hearse son

I got some bils to make

And I got time for war

Better bet I charge fast

like a lightning cord

I got bills and gates

I got a job for jobs

You like bill gates

You got a Micro-Soft

Fuck you and fuck spacex

matter fact, I wish your dad used a muthafuckin latex

I didn't wanna curse,

but I did it for the verse,

That's meta, do you get it?

cause i'm runnin outta patience

Good gracious

I'm seeing thru the Matrix

Twitters zero - one

Yeah That means no payslips

I threw a face hook

and tagged you on face book

With lyrics from this verse that just blew up like ya spaceship
